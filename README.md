# design-philosophy
- initial impression to create two layered components
	- layer-1 : core structures, components intended to take time text, validate it, process it and give back the result as british-spoken-time
		- add extensibility to support other locales
    - layer-2 : contains interfaces through which a user can access the core components of layer-1
